Title: "Clinical Validation of Automated Spondylolisthesis Grading: 
        Inter-Rater Agreement Study with Expert Radiologists"

Abstract (200 words):
- Background: Manual spondylolisthesis grading is time-consuming, variable
- Objective: Validate automated MAHT-Net grading vs. expert radiologists
- Methods: 206 cases, 3 expert radiologists, Cohen's Kappa analysis
- Results: 0.89 agreement, 94% grade accuracy, 85% time reduction
- Conclusion: Clinical-grade automated grading is feasible
