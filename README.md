# Spondylolisthesis MAHT-Net Project

This project aims to develop an automated grading system for spondylolisthesis using deep learning techniques. The primary focus is on implementing and benchmarking various models, including U-Net, ResNet Keypoint Detector, Keypoint R-CNN, and MAHT-Net.


## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mohamednourdine/spondylolisthesis-maht-net.git
cd spondylolisthesis-maht-net
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Exploration**: Use the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the dataset and visualize the characteristics of spondylolisthesis images.
2. **Model Training**: Implement and train the models using the provided notebooks. Each notebook corresponds to a specific model architecture.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using the evaluation scripts in the `src/evaluation` directory.
